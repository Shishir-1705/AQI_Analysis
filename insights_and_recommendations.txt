
Policy suggestions based on forecasts and EDA:
- Issue seasonal / festival-based warnings for cities with forecast spikes (e.g., winter months).
- Strengthen vehicular emission controls on days predicted to have poor air quality.
- Identify and monitor high-risk grid cells (use spatial heatmap) and deploy targeted interventions.
- Promote green cover & low-emission zones in consistently high-pollution areas.
- Further improvement: build an ensemble model combining ARIMA & Prophet for robustness.
